## 🛠️ Tools I Used
- **HTML5**: Builds the basic structure of my site.
- **CSS3**: Makes it look good and work on all screens:
  - **Reset**: Sets everything to zero (`margin: 0; padding: 0`) and keeps sizes neat (`box-sizing: border-box`).
  - **Media Query**: Shrinks the title and padding on small screens (600px or less).
  - **Google Fonts**: Uses Orbitron for a sci-fi look.

- **Cool Style**: Dark blue background (`#0d1b2a`) with bright cyan (`#00d4ff`) borders and text.
- **Fits Any Screen**: Stays centered (max 900px wide) and adjusts for phones.
